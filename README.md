# Attendance-App
This project is a work-in-progress. It focuses on integrating python with mySQL and google forms to record attendance of participants in an online meeting.
Future updates will bring a GUI for the application, which is to be implemented using Tkinter.
We are also trying to link the application with zoom API so that google forms can be comepletely replaced.
PLEASE NOTE: The code only works on windows, future updates will also bring in MACOS compatibility

Current drawbacks:
  i) The code only works on windows
  ii) While filling in google forms, someone can add attendance for another member (this is where API's come into play. We are also working on reading emails and               matching them to find duplicates and thus remove them.
